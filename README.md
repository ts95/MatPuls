## Brief description of the app
The app is made for Hege Skari's sole proprietorship called MatPuls. Her job
is to measure the temperature of foods and coolers (fridges, freezers etc.)
for companies and conclude whether the temperatures are within legal limits.
The idea behind the app is to simplify this process by providing an app
where she can create her future reports.
